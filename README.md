# Flashcard-app

Summary: This project contains a React app. It was assignment given to me in the software engineering program I am currently in.

Description: This app allows you to create decks of study cards (with name, description for the decks) and the ability to add cards to the deck. You 
also can edit and delete the cards in the decks as well as delete the decks. You can select a deck to study and flip through the cards which have questions on the front and answers on the back. 

Futher Details:

 I used react router to render all of the pages with unique urls directly from the index.js in the source folder. By doing this I avoided using nested routes which I preferred and it seemed appropriate due to the limited number of routes.
